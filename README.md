# Game of Thrones Ruby Game
This is a simple ruby game, based off of activity 45 in Ruby The Hard Way. 

The game is setup as a classic choose-your-own-adventure type game.
Simply follow the on-screen instructions and aim to progress as far as possible.

You can run it in any Ruby-compatible IDE of your choice. 
Just make sure to run the program through the "Engine.rb" file, not the "Storyline.rb" file.
The "Storyline.rb" file is an extension of the "Engine.rb" file.

Have fun!
